Various config files

*Note: The iTerm2 configuration now uses the `Sauce Code Pro Nerd Font Complete.ttf` font from this repo
and "SF Mono", which I cannot distribute. You can however [download it from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/),
assuming you are willing to accept the license agreement.*

## Instructions

- Begin by installing git if it isn't already and then clone this repo.
- Install SF Mono if you want it from https://developer.apple.com/fonts/, without it iTerm2 will default to using Menlo in its place.
